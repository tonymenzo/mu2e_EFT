# Information about isotopes for mu2e.py
# JS is the ground state spin
# TTMS is the
# delta is the mass defect in MeV from Nuclear Wallet Cards
# masses will be calculated when loaded.
# Entries from Table XV (note that precision here is higher than table??):
# Ebind:  Muon binding energy given Z (why isn't this calculated)
# Qeff:   momentum transfer to electron adjusted for coulomb interaction to get WF
#         (why isn't this calculated from eqn 12?)
# Zeff:   Adjustment to Z for muon wave function (eqn 26).
# fgAvg:  Ratio of average muon Dirac components <f>/<g>
# MuCapRate:  Muon Capture Rate
#         Ordinary muon capture rates in units of 1/sec; 
#         default values taken from the uncertainty-weighted average of the
