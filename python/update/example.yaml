Element:  "Cu"        # Can use UI element spelling Sulfur or it's symbol S (also Britsh sp)
# Isotope:  0         # 0 says to average
Isotope:  63          # 63 picks a specific Isotope of Cu
Interaction: GCN2850  # bw is short for "Brown-Wildenthal", which also works
oscb:     0           # in fm. Omit or set to 0 to calc from average A (Abar) over isotopes
MCR:      0           # omit or 0 for dflt, otherwise muon capture rate in sec^-1
                      # using:  b=Sqrt[41.467/(45*Abar^(-1/3) -25*Abar^(-2/3))]
                      # Automatically fixed for some interactions.
